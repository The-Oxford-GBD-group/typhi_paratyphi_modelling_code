# typhi_paratyphi_modelling_code
R code to model the prevalence of resistance in Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi

In the MBG folder is code used to produce subnational estimates of the prevalence of resistance in S. Typhi. The code is adapted from that from the Local Burden of Disease (LBD) 
group of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), available at https://github.com/ihmeuw/lbd.

In the STGPR folder is code to produce national estimates of the prevalence of resistance in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. A stacked ensemble model is used first then the outputs
of this input into the STGPR.

The STGPR code is from IHME and is cloned from https://github.com/ihmeuw/ihme-modeling/tree/master/gbd_2017/risk_factors_code/st_gpr
